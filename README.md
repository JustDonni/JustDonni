# 👋 Hi there!

I’m a self-taught systems programming enthusiast diving deep into how computers really work — from CPU boot to kernel space.  
Currently learning to build my own operating system, write drivers, compilers, and low-level Linux tools.

💡 Passionate about exploring internals, experimenting with code, and understanding how everything works "under the hood".

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🔧 Languages: Pascal · C · Rust · Assembly (NASM)
- 💻 Systems: OSDev · drivers · compilers
- 🐧 Linux: EndeavourOS (Hyprland) · ricing & performance tuning
- 🌐 Tools: NVchad · QEMU · Git · Makefile · Ranger (File Manager), VScode

## 🚀 What I’m working on

- ✏️ Learning systems programming (Pascal as first language → then C/ASM/Rust)
- ⚙️ Writing a simple OS
- 🔐 Exploring cybersecurity basics
